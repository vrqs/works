For over a decade I’ve been doing design and front-end at the company I worked for.
Kinda wild to think about it — started at 18, now I'm at 28 and some change.

Learned a lot there, worked with good people.
But it’s time to carve my own path.

Independence is the goal. I have nothing to show for those years — most of my work lives under the company. Everything else is outdated or offline.

Taking it as a fresh start.
